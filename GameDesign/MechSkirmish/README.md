# Mech Skirmish Game
For this game I would like to make a skirmish type game with mechs. This was
inspired by the game GKR Heavy hitters, which is a cool looking game but has a
bunch of mechanics that I think are dumb. It does have some really good ideas
though. I would like to borrow a lot from the Star Wars X-Wing skirmish game,
 but played on a hex board. I would also like to take from Heavy Hitters the
 deck and damage system. So you build a deck of cards at the begining that you
 use as your hand and also when you take damage you discard cards. When you run
 out of cards you are destroyed.

## Basics
Each player will choose a mech to play. Once you choose that mech you are given
the deck of cards associated with that mech. You then choose cards to make up
your deck. Each player will be limited in the number of cards they may choose (
Maybe all the same, say 25, or maybe mech dependent). The cards also make up
your hit points and represent systems breaking when you take damage. One of the
biggest choices in building the deck will be which weapons you take. There will
be a main gun and also several secondary weapons like missiles. Choosing which
weapons to take will change how your mech plays on the battle field.

All play will take place on a hex board and there will be buildings or other
terrain pieces that can count as cover. Other pieces on the board might be
objectives or scenario specific things that you have to get to or move around.

## Game Ideas Wishlist
Some general ideas or mechanics that I would really like to figure out how to
include.
 - Secret movement:
   * X-wing uses dials to select your movement and eveyone picks in secret all
   at once. The dials are then flipped and movement proceeds based on the skill
   of the pilot. For this game I would like to include the secret movement to
   get that feel of dog fighting that x-wing has.
   * I dont know if dials will work for this since it will be card based. The
   other option is making the movement card based. Each player could play a
   card in secret then execute the move based on the speed of the movement
   printed on the card. I am a little bit worried that this will make movement
   too limited since you will only be able to play what is in your hand. One
   big positive of this is that each mech could feel really different since
   they will all have their own unique deck to build from.
